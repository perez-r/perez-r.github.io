## Introduction
Throughout my studies here at Southern New Hampshire University, I’ve learned many valuable hard skills and soft skills that will prove to be useful in my professional career as a computer scientist. In the course IT-315: Object Oriented Analysis and Design, I designed a system for student course registration that allowed me to employ the practice of software engineering and design to fulfill the needs as described by the software design document. In addition, the course CS-250: Software Development Lifecycles taught me about the Agile framework for project management which allows me to employ strategies to communicate effectively to stakeholders and other members of the development team.This also allows me to design develop and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts as would be needed when working in a team environment on a software project. In the course CS-310: Collaboration and Team Projects, I collaborated with classmates on a Jukebox program which gave me an opportunity to learn about version control systems and to collaborate effectively in a team environment.I learned about databases and full-stack development in the course CS-340: Client/Server Development where I had to create a system for finding candidate canines for a search and rescue organization. In course CS-250, Data Structures and Algorithms, I implemented the knowledge I learned to design an auction bidding system that implemented different algorithms for sorting through data structures. Lastly, I designed a security policy for an engineering firm, based on pre-established security principles, that helped them employ secure coding standards for the firm to adhere to during normal operations.

The two artifacts that will follow are two perfect examples of my skills acquired while here at SNHU. The first artifact is an HVAC system built on an off-the-shelf microcontroller by Texas Instruments. This artifact allowed me to demonstrate my abilities at software design and engineering to accomplish an industry specific goal by implementation of a finite-state machine using this microcontroller and the hardware drivers that it utilizes. The second artifact is a Zoo Employee System that allows them to authenticate themselves and gain access to the file they are authorized to access. This artifact allowed me to demonstrate my abilities at working with databases and using data structures and algorithms towards a specific goal while using keeping a security mindset. 

# Portfolio Artifact One

### [HVAC State Machine](https://github.com/perez-r/perez-r.github.io/blob/main/Artifact%20One/Updated/gpiointerrupt.c)
![Texas Instruments CC3220S LaunchpadXL](https://github.com/perez-r/perez-r.github.io/blob/main/Artifact%20One/TI-CC3220S-LAUNCHPADXL.jpeg)
Using a microcontroller, this program is an HVAC control system that senses senses temperature and enables or disables heating or cooling system depending on the reading. Uses GPIO inputs to control temperature settings and utilizes UART and I2C for communications communications.
