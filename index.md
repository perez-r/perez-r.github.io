## Introduction
Throughout my studies here at Southern New Hampshire University, I’ve learned many valuable hard skills and soft skills that will prove to be useful in my professional career as a computer scientist. In the course IT-315: Object Oriented Analysis and Design, I designed a system for student course registration that allowed me to employ the practice of software engineering and design to fulfill the needs as described by the software design document. In addition, the course CS-250: Software Development Lifecycles taught me about the Agile framework for project management which allows me to employ strategies to communicate effectively to stakeholders and other members of the development team.This also allows me to design develop and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts as would be needed when working in a team environment on a software project. In the course CS-310: Collaboration and Team Projects, I collaborated with classmates on a Jukebox program which gave me an opportunity to learn about version control systems and to collaborate effectively in a team environment.I learned about databases and full-stack development in the course CS-340: Client/Server Development where I had to create a system for finding candidate canines for a search and rescue organization. In course CS-250, Data Structures and Algorithms, I implemented the knowledge I learned to design an auction bidding system that implemented different algorithms for sorting through data structures. Lastly, I designed a security policy for an engineering firm, based on pre-established security principles, that helped them employ secure coding standards for the firm to adhere to during normal operations.

The two artifacts that will follow are two perfect examples of my skills acquired while here at SNHU. The first artifact is an HVAC system built on an off-the-shelf microcontroller by Texas Instruments. This artifact allowed me to demonstrate my abilities at software design and engineering to accomplish an industry specific goal by implementation of a finite-state machine using this microcontroller and the hardware drivers that it utilizes. The second artifact is a Zoo Employee System that allows them to authenticate themselves and gain access to the file they are authorized to access. This artifact allowed me to demonstrate my abilities at working with databases and using data structures and algorithms towards a specific goal while using keeping a security mindset. 

# Portfolio Artifact One

### [HVAC State Machine (Updated)](https://github.com/perez-r/perez-r.github.io/tree/main/Artifact%20One/Updated)

#### A.	Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
The artifact I’ve selected is a project where I used an off-the-shelf microcontroller to design a thermostat. The project was completed in the C programming language and involved using the device’s drivers to achieve the desired functionality using the hardware on the microcontroller. I completed this project for course CS-350: Emerging Systems Architecture and Technology here at SNHU. It was completed and submitted in August of 2021. 

#### B.	Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?
I selected this artifact to include in my ePortfolio because this assignment required me to design a state machine with time-based events with limitations on the number of resources available as a microcontroller board was used. I felt as though this demonstrated my ability to design software that I’ve acquired here at SNHU. In addition, this assignment required me to learn to use the device drivers and adapt the code to my needs. This demonstrates my ability to work with code developed by others and integrate my own code into it. To improve this artifact, I opted to extend the functionality beyond the thermostat for heating and add support for cooling too. Modern HVAC systems have functionality for both heating and cooling and I thought it best to extend the functionality to match this. I also improved the commenting on the code, increasing its readability and usability. 

#### C.	Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?
The course objective I originally intended to meet in this enhancement of this artifact was course objective four, “Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals,” specifically the software engineering and design portion of this course outcome. I feel as though I am meeting the course objective that I set out to meet with this enhancement. In modern day, IoT devices have grown to be a massive industry and many of these use state machines as they have limited resources and only need a limited number of states to exist in. Demonstrating my ability to design a state machine constrained by limited resources of a microcontroller represents a real-world application of software design and engineering. I don’t believe I have any updates to my outcome coverage plans described in my initial refinement and enhancement plan document.  

#### D.	Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?
When I first opened this project again, I realized just how much I had forgotten it. Although it was less than a year ago since I created this, I did not need to reference it at all so it’s functionality was a bit confusing for me to understand. This is when I learned how important commenting really is. Although it was my own code, my comments were brief and vague. I had to run through it all little by little before my code review so I could understand what was going on again. In addition to my own code, I also had to re-learn how the drivers are used in this software. Adding detailed but concise comments was where I started before making any changes to the actual code. This was truly the only major challenge I needed to overcome for this enhancement. It took some time to relearn how the program worked and update the comments but without doing so, I would not have been able to make the enhancements I did. The lesson I learned here I must remember when working on the other enhancements I have planned for my ePortfolio and in my future professional career.

# Portfolio Artifact Two & Three

### [Zoo Employee Access System and Database (Updated)](https://github.com/perez-r/perez-r.github.io/tree/main/Artifact%20Two%20and%20Three/Updated)

#### A. Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?
The artifact I’ve enhanced for this module is a project completed in course IT-145: Foundations in Application Development created around April 2019. The goal of the project was to create a system for users to authenticate themselves and gain access to the appropriate file they were authorized to access. The program was written in Java and included two classes: an Authentication.java class that contained the main function and primary program logic; and a ValidateCredentials.java file that handled the encryption and validation of users and it also accessed and output the contents of the file the user was authorized to access. 

#### B. Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?
I chose this artifact because for the previous milestone, I chose to improve the encryption from MD5 to an XOR encryption using a key. For this reason, I chose to further upgrade this system to use a MongoDB database instead of keeping sensitive data in text files. This achieves a more secure system. I also made this program more modular and reusable by adding classes that can be used with minor modifications for other applications beyond a zoo. I added a class specifically made to interface with the database so the other classes didn’t directly interact with the database, limiting the number of requests made to the server to only when absolutely necessary. 

#### C. Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans? 
I did meet the course objectives I planned to meet with this enhancement. This artifact meets three course objectives: proficiency in data structures/algorithms, proficiency in software engineering/design,  databases, and lastly employs secure coding practices. The proficiency in data structures and algorithms is met in the Encryption.java file as I improved the algorithm and am using an XOR encryption algorithm. This increases the security so it also achieves the secure coding practice objective. The program was upgraded to include the use of a database as opposed to plain text files to store the user credentials and access levels which meets the proficiency in databases and again the proficiency in secure coding practices. This artifact also required a significant amount of re-engineering to support the use of a database meeting the objective for software engineering.

#### D. Reflect on the process of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?
Although I enjoyed working on this artifact, this was likely the most time consuming artifact I had. Before I could even begin coding, I had to setup and configure the database using MongoDB’s cloud solution. I also had to take the time to learn the MongoDB Java driver, BSON, JSON, and BSON Document objects because they would be used while coding. This proved to be an issue because my earlier difficulties with my previous artifact selection left me with limited amounts of time to actually work and prepare on this artifact. I feel as though there are a lot of improvements and changes, I could make to my artifact to make it work better. I feel as though it’s just in a working state which is a mistake on my part by undertaking such a large task in such a short period. If I had chosen this particular artifact from the beginning, I could have begun work on it much earlier. This is a lesson to me in preparedness and adaptability. I need to remember to get as well-prepared as I can ahead of time. In terms of adaptability, I believe I managed the change well but there is room for improvement. In the real world, there are sudden changes that will need to be adapted to, so I believe that although not my original intention, the experience was beneficial for me. Overall, although challenging, I was successful in my artifact update and will try to make more changes to it for when the time comes to seek employment and demonstrate my abilities through this portfolio to future employers.
